## Notes

### Part 2

1. "from __future__ import annotations" seems to confuse 3.8
2. Why use numpy except for the slice syntax?
3. I got a circular reference using the type annotations

### Part 3

1. I'm still not having much luck with the type annotations and I think they might be confusing for a tutorial.
2. Some of the functions have a lot of arguments.It might be easier to keep them all in a config object.

### Part 4

1. I rushed through this because I'm catching up but the results are very cool.
2. The Numpy stuff might be overcomplicated for a tutorial though.
