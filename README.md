https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

* Part 0 - Setting Up [no tag]
* Part 1 - Drawing the '@' symbol and moving it around [v1.1.0]
* Part 2 - The generic Entity, the render functions, and the map


## Notes

2. Why use numpy except for the slice syntax?
3. I got a circular reference using the type annotations
